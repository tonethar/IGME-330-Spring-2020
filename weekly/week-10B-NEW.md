# Week 10B - Computational Literature & Context-free grammars with Rita.js

## I. Overview & Agenda
- Today we will use RiTa.js to analyze the parts of speech of text, and utilize this capability to create a "Mad Libs" application
- We will also learn about *Context-free Grammars*

## II. Lecture Notes & Homework

- [Text-4 - The RiTa.js Computational Text Library](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/text-4.md)
- [Text-5 - *Context-free Grammars*](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/text-5.md)

## III. HW Assignments

- *Maddening Libs* - the requirements for which are at the end of Text-4 above
- *ill-Favored Coast* - the requirements for which are at the end of Text-5 above - this won't take too long!

## IV. Videos

- These videos cover the topics of Text-4 above, and will help you with the *Maddening Libs* HW:
  - [Text-4: Rita-1 - Intro to Rita (12:08)](https://video.rit.edu/Watch/rita-js-1-intro)
