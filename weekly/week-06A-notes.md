  3) Due in myCourses dropbox class Thursday 3/5/2020, start of class:
    - working prototype #2 - at a bare minimum a "minimum viable product" that shows your main features and idea - to the dropbox

  4) Final Project Submission:
    - because we have a midterm on Thursday 3/5/2020 (the end of week 8, and right before spring break) - and we want you to have the time to do a good job on both this project and the midterm ...
