<a id="review"></a>

## I. Overview & Agenda
- "Old" stuff:
  - Review Midterm Exam
  - Look at Project 2 submissions
- "New" Stuff
  - Loading text into the browser
    - HW - *Palindrome Detector*
  - 

- Look at another *constrained writing* technique
- Look at word counting, stop words, and building a word cloud app
- **Final Project** - Just a preview of where we are headed - don't worry - we still have plenty to cover - and it's not due until finals week: [Project 3 - MVVM Web App Mashup of Awesomeness!](../projects/project-3.md)
- **Upcoming HW assignments:**
  - Check the myCourses dropboxes. There are 2 assignments due XX/XX (one of these is easy), and 2 assignments due XX/XX (one of these is easy). But regardless, don't wait until the night before to do these, work ahead on the assignments that you are able to!
