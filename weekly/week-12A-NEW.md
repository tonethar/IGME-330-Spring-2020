# Week 12A - Client-side web applications

## I. Overview & Agenda
 - Creating a PHP *proxy server*
 - Downloading and parsing web services (review)

## II. Lecture Notes
 - [PHP Web Service Part V - creating a proxy server](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-php-web-service-5.md)
  - this reviews how to utilize a simple web API - http://www.boredapi.com - we'll create **bored-client.html** to download this data
  - we look at a web service that our client-side JavaScript is unable to download - http://shoutcloud.io - but it CAN be downloaded by a PHP script
  - thus we will create a PHP *proxy server* that will download the data from shoutcloud, and then send this data to our client application
  - this walks through the creation of **shout-proxy.php** and **shout-client.html**
