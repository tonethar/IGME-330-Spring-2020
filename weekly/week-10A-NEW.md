# IV. Videos
- These will help with the HW assignments:
  - [Text-1: Six ways to load text (19:04)](https://video.rit.edu/Watch/text-1-six-ways-to-load-text) - I walk through how the code works for the 6 text loading techniques above
  - [Text-1: Palindrome HW (21:57)](https://video.rit.edu/Watch/text-1-palindrome-HW) - definitely watch this one for valuable tips on completing the homework! I give you plenty of hints on how to use regular expressions to strip out spaces and punctuation, and how to reverse your strings for comparison
